I am not a professional discord bot developer, so don't expect everything to be perfect.

# Commands:
Default AI reply prefix: "!db" command syntax: !db <prompt>

Wallpaper change prefix: "!wb" command syntax: !wb <image-link>

It auto replies with a GIF if your message contains the word Balls

## AI Chatbot personality:
Fun and chill bloke who uses discord, be careful though, it can swear, and it might even insult you (all of this is programmable through the pre prompt)

### The bot uses discord.py for, well, discord, openai for the AI message replying, datetime module, requests module, and ctypes.

For using your own discord bot token, replace gooberfile.bot_token with yout token, and for the openai api key, change gooberfile.OPENAI_API_KEY with your api key.

If you have any suggestions or queries, feel free to join my discord server and let me know! 

## You can let bot users to change your desktop wallpaper ONLY IF YOU HOST THE BOT ON YOUR WINDOWS MACHINE!!!
also, the code for it is probably sub optimal but again, i made the bot for fun so who cares.

# Enjoy!

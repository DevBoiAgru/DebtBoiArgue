### The bot uses discord.py for, well, discord, openai for the AI message replying.

For using your own bot token, openai key or other keys, go to make a .env and set all your secrets as following:

```
export BOT_TOKEN = "your token"
export OPENAI_API_KEY = "api key"
export API_NINJA_KEY = "api key"
export REDDIT_CLIENT_ID = "client id"
export REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET = "client secret"
export REDDIT_USER_AGENT = "user agent"
```

## APIs used:
api-ninjas.com
random.dog
thecatapi.com
openai
reddit

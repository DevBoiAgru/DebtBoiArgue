I am not a professional discord bot developer, so don't expect everything to be perfect.

# Feature list:

Help: command syntax: !dhelp

AI reply: command syntax: !db prompt
with cooldown to prevent spamming and rate limiting.

Cat photos: !meow for random cat photo / gif

Dog photos: !woof for random dog photo / gif

Dad joke: !dadjoke

Joke: !joke

Fun fact: !fact

Auto replies with a GIF if your message contains the word Balls

Auto replies the "crazy? i was crazy once" copypasta if your message contains the word Crazy.

Replies with a certain message to every message a user with specific User ID sends. (change this by replacing gooberfile.clingtarget with the user ID you want)

And much more to come!

## AI Chatbot personality:
Fun and chill bloke who uses discord, be careful though, it can swear, and it might even insult you (all of this is programmable through the pre prompt)

### The bot uses discord.py for, well, discord, openai for the AI message replying.

For using your own discord bot token, replace gooberfile.bot_token with yout token, and for the openai api key, change gooberfile.OPENAI_API_KEY with your api key.
or you could make your own gooberfile.py and out your api keys in it.

If you have any suggestions or queries, feel free to join my discord server and let me know! 

## You can let bot users to change your desktop wallpaper ONLY IF YOU HOST THE BOT ON YOUR WINDOWS MACHINE!!!
also, the code for it is probably sub optimal but again, i made the bot for fun so who cares.

# Enjoy!

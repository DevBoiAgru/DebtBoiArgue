A fun little bot made because i was bored

I am not a professional discord bot developer, so don't expect everything to be perfect.

Default AI reply prefix: "!db" command syntax: !db <prompt>
Wallpaper change prefix: "!wb" command syntax: !wb <image-link>
It auto replies with a GIF if your message contains the word Balls


The bot uses discord.py for, well, discord, openai for the AI message replying, datetime module, requests module, and ctypes.

If you have any suggestions or queries, feel free to join my discord server and let me know! 

## You can let bot users to change your desktop wallpaper ONLY IF YOU HOST THE BOT ON YOUR WINDOWS MACHINE!!!
also, the code for it is probably sub optimal but again, i made the bot for fun so who cares.

# Enjoy!

I am not a professional discord bot developer, so don't expect everything to be perfect.

# Feature list:

Help: command syntax: /help

AI reply: command syntax: /db prompt
with cooldown to prevent spamming and rate limiting.

Random cat photos: /meow

Random dog photos: /woof

Dad joke: /dadjoke

Joke: /joke

Fun fact: /fact

Meme (random hot post from specified meme subs): /meme

And much more to come!

## AI Chatbot personality:
Fun and chill bloke who uses discord, be careful though, it can swear, and it might even insult you (all of this is programmable through the pre prompt)

### The bot uses discord.py for, well, discord, openai for the AI message replying.

For using your own discord bot token, replace gooberfile.bot_token with yout token, and for the openai api key, change gooberfile.OPENAI_API_KEY with your api key.
or you could make your own gooberfile.py and out your api keys in it.
